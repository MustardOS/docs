# Image Format
There are currently three compatible image formats for themes with specific use cases; 

- **`.bmp`** - the bootlogo only (24-bit, True Colour bitmap).
- **`.png`** - any static images within `./images/static/`, backgrounds in `./images/wall/`, and overlay.png.
- **`.gif`** - creating animated backgrounds within `./images/wall`. 

What is consistent across most of these uses is that the resolution has to be ***640x480 resolution*** (same as the device itself).

> *Tip: If you are struggling to find a method to easily convert an image to a 24-bit* `.bmp` *file, there are many [online converters](https://online-converting.com/image/convert2bmp/) that
> can do this for you. There are also similar places to convert a video file to a* `.gif` *file [easily](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) as well.*

# Custom Graphics
If you are new to graphic design in this context, there are many places you can start with to get the most out of the muOS theme engine.
Most people designing visual assets will use software such as Photoshop, Photopea (this one is [online and free to use](https://www.photopea.com/)), Illustrator, GIMP, Aseprite (pixel art app), or Affinity.

Feel free to take inspiration from other themes as well if you are struggling to find a way to implement the perfect type of
menu navigation for your theme.
