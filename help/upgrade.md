## Requirements
This guide is designed for people running muOS Baked Beans.
Any other version is not supported.
You must also be using a 2 SD card setup.

## Can I directly upgrade over the top of muOS Baked Beans?
Unfortunately no.
The move from muOS Baked Beans to muOS Banana involved a huge rework of the underlying systems.
The changes to the file system makes a direct upgrade **impossible**.

## Migrating Data
The answer to this dilemma is migrating all of your user data to SD Card 2.
Starting with muOS Banana you can store saves, configs, artwork, bios and more on SD2.

To faciliate this migration we have prepared the following script which can be installed using the Archive Manager in muOS Baked Beans.

{: .warning}
> While we do our best to ensure this script works correctly, **please backup** any data you do not want to lose!
> Use of this script is at your own risk!
> The Migrate Script **Does not** remove any data from SD1
