# muOS Artwork
## Changes since muOS Origin `v10`
Box Art / Preview Art / Game Text is no longer tied to the directory structure you use for your ROMs.  
All of these files are now stored in a location referred to as the **catalogue.**

## muOS Catalogue Structure
Folders for all available systems should be automatically created for you.  
These systems match the `catalogue=` entry in `/mnt/mmc/MUOS/info/assign/<system>.ini`
### Example ini file
```ini
[global]
name=Atari 2600
default=Stella
catalogue=Atari 2600
cache=0
```
Here we can see the catalogue folder for this system is `Atari 2600`.  

**All game artwork should be named to match your ROMs.**  
```

            │    │   └── foldername.png

            │    └── text
            │        └── foldername.txt
            └── Root

```
As muOS assigns artwork by system, you will need to assign a core before artwork is displayed.  
Starting in `muOS Beans` it should attempt to assign a system automatically.

**Example**  
If you have some ROMs in:
```
/mnt/sdcard/roms/Nintendo/SNES/Action/*.zip
```
Artwork files for this system go in:
```
/mnt/mmc/MUOS/info/catalogue/Nintendo SNES-SFC/
```
The folder named **Folder** can be used to apply artwork to any folder in content explorer and just needs to match the folder name.  
(_not case sensitive_).
To have folder icons for all subdirectories listed, you would need:
```
catalogue
└── Folder
    └── box
        ├── nintendo.png
        ├── snes.png
        └── action.png
```
